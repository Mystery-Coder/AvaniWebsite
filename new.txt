The web of life

Subject: Environment,

Duration: 60 minutes

Materials: Biological and inorganic components, paper clips, pins, ball of thread

OBJECTIVE: To understand the interrelationships between organisms and environmental components through play and to interpret food webs through food webs.

Activity

Have students write the names of bio-inorganic elements/components on pieces of paper.

✓ Wear the pieces of paper for all to see. Players in a circle.

✓ Let the sun keep the ball of thick thread. Wrap one end around his thumb and decide who he wants to give light/energy to.

✓ Let the creature wrap the thread around its thumb and hand over the thread to the creature/s that can shelter it or that it can shelter.

✓ Let that creature hand over the thread to an edible creature / non-living creature who can feed it.

✓ Each participant needs habitat, food, dish, and food for their survival. And thinking about other direct/indirect ecological roles, they continue the process of establishing specific     relationships.

✓ Continuing like this, all living/non-living entities are connected by thread.
Interpretation of activity

•Let all hold fast to their rope ends.

• Asking whether the facilitator can identify the beginning and end of the network respectively, this seems impossible. It is clear that this complex network of relationships is the foundation of the existence of the living world

• Facilitators can demonstrate that the entire network is healthy only if it is sustainable.

Discussion

What are the concepts learned through this game?

Difference between food chain and food web and life web

Discuss how other elements of the biome contribute to the survival of the forest beetle.

Activity

• Players stand or sit in a circle.

• Ask a player to volunteer.

• A card is placed on the player's back (by showing the black and white sides) with the help of a clip without telling the player which one it is. Attach as seen. Card

  Now ask the player to walk around the circle so the other players can see what the card represents.

• It is the player's job to identify who he/she represents by asking relevant questions.

• Others should only answer questions with 'yes' or 'no'.

• A player can ask a maximum of 8 questions. As the number of questions is limited, the player must be careful in the selection of questions and structure them logically, e.g. Based on the classification of animals and plants, for example, am I a mammal? i amPlayers stand or sit in a circle.

Do I eat meat?, Am I aquatic? ..

• As the game progresses. It may increase the number of questions to ten to make it more competitive.

• Volunteers can play the game in 10-15 rounds with different players on different environmental creatures.

Discussion

How did the players find the answers?

What classification principles did they use?
